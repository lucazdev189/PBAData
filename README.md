Out of boredom, I have decided to make this simple package that gives everyone an easy way to access Professional Bowlers Association data.

## Installing the package
```
library(devtools)
install_github("lucazdev189/PBAData")
```

### Initializing the PBA Tour 2023 dataset
Using the load_pba2023() function, you are able to do this.

And you may further play around with the dataset by doing this,
```
PBA2023 <- load_pba2023()
```
