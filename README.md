# PBAData - the package for bowling
Out of boredom, I have decided to make this simple package that gives everyone an easy way to access bowling data.

## Initializing the PBA Tour 2024 dataset
Using the load_dataset() function, you are able to do this.

And you may further play around with the dataset by doing this,
`PBA2024 <- load_dataset()`
